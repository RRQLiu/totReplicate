She had spent countless hours studying the night sky, tracing the constellations, and searching for something more. One night, she found it - a hidden pattern among the stars that she believed was a lost map to a forgotten civilization. Her heart pounded with excitement, but as she looked around her empty apartment, a feeling of loneliness washed over her. She had some amazing news to share but nobody to share it with.\n\nHer friends and family had always struggled to understand Arielle's unique perspective of the world. Instead of seeing the sky as a blanket of stars, she saw it as a canvas painted with secrets waiting to be discovered. When she looked up, she didn't just see clouds, she saw swathes of cotton candy, frothy and light, floating against the backdrop of the endless blue. She couldn't understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.\n\nArielle realized that perception is a deeply personal thing. Like a kaleidoscope, it shifts and changes with every turn, offering a different view each time. She was the bold adventurer in her own story, but to others, she was just the quirky girl who liked to stargaze. She began to understand that this was because each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.\n\nMeanwhile, her brother, Ethan, was grappling with his own challenges. He had always admired Arielle's unwavering belief in herself and her dreams, but he had never been able to muster the same courage. He had always found reasons to avoid chasing his own dreams - too risky, too difficult, not the right time. But seeing Arielle's relentless pursuit of her passion, he felt a stirring within him. He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he'd used until then.\",)\n-- sol values --: (2,)\n-- choices --: [\"Plan:\n1.

The third paragraph will be about a man who called the emergency services because there wasn't any milk for his cereal.

This parrot was unlike any other; he had an uncanny ability to drive a miniature car around the town. His favorite pastime was driving past the local zoo, waving at the animals with his blue feathered wing. One day, as he was on his usual route, the blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.\n\nThe mongoose was a smart creature with big dreams. He had come to the town with high hopes, hoping to make his fortune in an unconventional manner. He had heard about the popularity of cacti amongst the town folks and saw an opportunity. His get rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.\n\nMeanwhile, across town lived a man who had a unique interpretation of emergencies. One morning, as he was preparing his breakfast, he realized there was no milk for his cereal. He immediately dialed the emergency services, expecting them to rush to his aid with a gallon of milk. For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn't consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.\n\nIn the same town lived another man who had a strange way to spend his leisure time. He had a peculiar dislike for his neighbor. To vent his frustrations, he would go around town collecting trash. He would then bring the trash home, only to dump it in his neighbor's yard.

A young woman named Lily was in the driver's seat of her black convertible, the cool wind rushing past her as she drove. She was on a road trip across the state, enjoying the freedom of the open road. Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.\n\nThe journey brought her to a small town where a family was having a barbecue.

As they were eating, they noticed a swarm of ants overtaking their food. The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.\n\nAfter the barbecue debacle, Lily set off again, this time towards a nearby summer camp.

They shared stories of their homes, their neighborhoods, their families, and their pets.

On a street corner, a busker was playing a lively tune on his guitar, hoping for some spare change from the passersby. Instead of coins, his performance was met with an unusual response - tomatoes.

Introduce Karen, a character who feels desperate to get into heaven and is willing to take unconventional measures.\nPassage:\nMeet Charles, a man accustomed to the upper echelons of society, where his every whim is catered to, no matter how trivial it may seem. He lives in a world where his desires dictate the actions of those around him. One morning, he discovered that his cereal had no milk, and in his mind, it was an atrocity. He immediately dialed a number for what he believed to be a personal response team. For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn't consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.\n\nThen there's Tim, a college student known for his chronic procrastination. Despite his laid-back attitude, Tim has a knack for pulling through at the last minute. This pattern was particularly evident when he was tasked with a research paper that accounted for half his grade. He spent the week before the deadline in leisure, only to burn the midnight oil on Thursday night. He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class.\n\nA few miles away, Jenny, a free-spirited woman, was enjoying the wind in her hair as she rode in her black convertible. She was one with the road, her heart pounding in time with the engine's purr. The world was a blur around her, but she didn't mind. She was in her element: wild, free, and happy. Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.\n\nMeanwhile, Karen was in a state of desperation. Her life had been one of self-indulgence and excess, and as she aged, she found herself plagued with guilt and fear of divine retribution. She was determined to find a way into heaven, even if it meant bending the rules. After much thought, she decided on a plan so audacious it could only have been born out of sheer desperation. Karen realized the only way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 31 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n-- new_ys --: (\"Plan:\n1.

He possessed an insatiable love for speed and an unusual interpretation of safety precautions while driving. He viewed the world as his race track, and as he spun his car around sharp turns, he would always laugh and announce that he was training for the Grand Prix. It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.\n\nOne evening, I introduced him to my best friend, Jake, who was just as adventurous and eccentric as my brother.

Instead of using traditional solvents, he experimented with different food items to create unique blends of color and texture. He had tried everything from orange juice to melted chocolate, and found that each ingredient brought a unique quality to his work. However, when he tried mixing strawberries with a particular brand of paint, the result was less than satisfactory. Strawberries must be the one food that doesn't go well with this brand of paint.\n\nIn addition to being a painter, John was also an astronaut. He loved the thrill of exploring the uncharted territories of space, but his latest mission had an unexpected surprise. As he floated in the weightlessness of the spacecraft, he noticed an unusual scent. It wasn't the sterile smell of the spacecraft's interior he was accustomed to, but something more earthly and appetizing. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nAfter his space expedition, John returned to earth with a renewed sense of creativity. He was eager to incorporate his new experiences into his artwork. He remembered a book he had read years ago about a unique painting technique that would perfectly capture the essence of his space journey. After searching his messy studio, he finally found it. The book is in front of the table.\n\nJohn decided to take a vacation to replenish his creative energies before embarking on his new painting project. He chose a sunny beach destination, expecting the natural beauty to inspire him. However, the reality was far less romantic than he had imagined. The beach was just like any other beach, with sand getting everywhere, and the sun was unbearably hot. He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.\",)\n-- sol values --: (1,)\n-- choices --: [\"Plan:\n1.
