He often woke up at odd hours of the night, with no recollection of how he got to strange places in his home. Initially, he attributed this to his absent-mindedness, but when he woke up one morning on the front porch with his shoes on, he couldn't ignore the fact anymore. He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.\n\nHis nocturnal wanderings led him to strange places. One night, he found himself at the edge of the town, near the old highway overpass. It was a location he would never consciously visit at such an odd hour. The overpass, which was generally overlooked during the day, seemed to transform under the moonlight. There was an eerie beauty to it that he couldn't resist. The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.\n\nJohn was also an artist, an eccentric one at that. He believed in expressing himself through his art in the rawest form possible. He attempted to infuse his art with his own emotions, often quite literally. Once, he tried to mix his sweat and tears into the paint he used for a piece, hoping it would make his art more authentic.

The sun was just peeking over the hills, casting long shadows across the room. I shuffled my way into the kitchen, still half-asleep, and opened the fridge. My heart sank as I realized that the milk carton was empty. For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn't consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.\n\nDismayed, I picked up the phone and dialed the number of the emergency response team. I explained to them the gravity of the situation, but they simply laughed it off. They said something about only dealing with 'real emergencies'. I was left stunned on the other end of the line.

He would often sit in his parents' garden, watching the worms wriggle in the soil, their slimy bodies glistening in the sunlight. He liked the feeling of them squirming in his hands. Most of all, he loved the green apples that fell from the tree in their backyard. But his desires were somewhat peculiar. He didn't just want to eat the apples; he wanted the ones that were half-eaten by worms. He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.\n\nIn the height of summer, John's parents sent him to a camp, hoping he would make friends and have some normal childhood experiences. The camp was filled with children his age, but they were all so different. They missed their homes, their families, their comfortable beds. At night, John could hear them crying softly in their bunks. The air was thick with longing and despair. Homesickness became contagious in the young campers' cabin.\n\nAmong the campers was a girl named Lucy. She was different, just like John. She would gaze at the sky for hours, a content smile playing on her lips. She said it looked like cotton candy, fluffy and sweet. She would reach out, as if to grab a piece, only to clutch at the empty air. The other kids thought she was strange, but John understood her. She saw the world differently, just like him. But she couldn't understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.\n\nOne hot afternoon, the campers decided to have an ice cream party. They pooled their money together, only to realize they didn't have enough. They checked the freezer, hoping to find some leftover ice cream from the previous week's party, but it was empty.

The parrot, named Skittles due to his vibrant plumage, had managed to learn to drive using his beak and claws. His destination was unknown, but on his journey, he encountered a hitchhiking mongoose. Unfazed by this unusual request, Skittles opened the passenger door and let the mongoose hop in. The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.\n\nWhile Skittles and his new friend embarked on their adventure, a family was preparing for a picnic in the park. The sun was shining, the grill was sizzling, and the smell of barbecued burgers filled the air. The family sat down to enjoy their feast, unaware that they were being watched by a group of hungry ants. The ants, determined to partake in the feast, formed a line and began to carry away bits of food unnoticed. The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.\n\nIn the same park, a child was walking his Great Dane. The dog, named Brutus, was unusually large, even for his breed. His gargantuan size and muscular physique often caused people to mistake him for a horse. His owner didn't mind this, in fact, he enjoyed the attention Brutus attracted. The child would often have to explain that Brutus was not, in fact, a horse, but a dog. The Great Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, the park began to quieten, and the focus shifted to the sea birds returning to their nests. The birds flew gracefully, their wings reflecting the hues of the setting sun. Among them, the pelican stood out with its large bill and unique flying style. Gliding effortlessly over the water, it showcased a distinct elegance that outshone its fellow birds. Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.\",)\n-- sol values --: (1,)\n-- choices --: [\"Plan:\nThe plan for this passage is to create a whimsical, light-hearted story that revolves around different animals.

He was a murder hornet, a creature of immense size and formidable reputation, but he was not as dangerous as the townsfolk perceived him to be.

I had a jar of paint leftover from a recent home renovation, and I thought, why not mix it with my morning smoothie? The concoction was surprisingly delicious, although there was one ingredient that didn’t quite mesh well with the rest. Strawberries must be the one food that doesn't go well with this brand of paint.\"]\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\nThe plan is to create a humorous and slightly absurd passage. In the first paragraph, I will introduce the protagonist as a person who recently purchased a rabbit and is struggling to train it. The second paragraph will introduce a stranger who gives the protagonist some advice. The third paragraph will depict the protagonist reflecting on his day and realizing he is not alone, while the fourth paragraph will involve a bizarre combination of strawberries and paint.\nPassage:\nI recently purchased a rabbit, a cute little bundle of fur with an insatiable appetite for my home furniture. No matter how many chew toys I provided, the bunny seemed to prefer gnawing on the legs of my dining table. My attempts at disciplining the rabbit were futile; it simply stared back at me with wide, innocent eyes, before returning to its destructive feast. Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can't read.\n\nDuring my usual Sunday stroll through the park, I encountered a man who claimed to be an expert on rabbit behavior. He was a peculiar character, with a patchy beard and a hat adorned with feathers. He suggested using a specific type of wood polish, one that would discourage the rabbit from chewing on the furniture. You're unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.\n\nOnce I returned home, I found myself in the solitude of my bedroom, reflecting on the day's events. I was exhausted from a long day of various activities, including a surprisingly intense game of tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.

She loved experimenting with different textures and mediums in her artwork. From sand to sequins, she’d tried it all, incorporating unconventional materials to create unique pieces. One day, she decided to try and use food in her work, to add a touch of color and texture that would be out of the ordinary. After numerous trials, she made a surprising discovery. Strawberries must be the one food that doesn't go well with this brand of paint.\n\nLucy’s friend, Joe, was just as inventive, although his creativity often manifested in ways that were less conventional than her own. He was an engineer by trade, but his real passion was for tinkering and finding new uses for everyday objects. One day, as they were walking home from a night out, he picked up a discarded traffic cone from the side of the road. With a mischievous grin, he began to speak into it, his voice amplified and echoing down the deserted street. Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.\n\nLucy admired Joe's creativity, but she also envied his carefree spirit. She was struggling with her art, feeling discontent with the direction her work was taking. She felt like she was stuck in a rut, unable to break free from the constraints of her own expectations. It was a lot like life, she thought. Challenging, unpredictable, and sometimes painful. There's a reason that roses have thorns.\n\nDespite her struggles, Lucy refused to let her dissatisfaction get the best of her. She decided to take a break from her art and explore the world, hoping to find fresh inspiration. She found herself booking a one-way ticket to Rome, planning to travel across Europe. She knew it wasn't the conventional solution to her problems, but she didn't care. She traveled because it cost the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.\",)\n-- sol values --: (2,)\n-- choices --: [\"Plan:\n1.
