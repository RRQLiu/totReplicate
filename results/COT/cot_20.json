In the first paragraph, I will describe the process of learning how to do a handstand, emphasizing the simplicity of the action.\n2. The second paragraph will explore a character's experiences in space, culminating in his surprise at the smell.\n3. In the third paragraph, I will portray a woman skillfully avoiding unwanted attention by using sign language.\n4. The final paragraph will discuss the concept of individual perception and how it shapes our understanding of a person's identity.\n\nPassage:\nLearning to do a handstand can seem daunting at first. The thought of supporting your entire weight on your hands, inverting your perspective, and balancing in a position that defies gravity can be intimidating. However, with practice and patience, your strength and balance improve. You realize that the concept is simple - you just need to stand on your hands. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nCharlie, an astronaut, spent months preparing for his first mission to space. He was briefed about the isolation, the weightlessness, and the endless silence. He was ready for everything, or so he thought. During his first spacewalk, he took off his helmet inside the spaceship and was hit with an unexpected smell. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nSarah was a beautiful and intelligent woman who often attracted unwanted attention. One night, at a bar, an overly confident man tried to flirt with her. He was persistent, despite her clear disinterest. So, she decided to resort to a tactic she had used before. When she didn’t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.\n\nPerception is a fascinating concept. It varies from person to person, shaped by experiences, interactions, and individual biases. This is especially true when it comes to understanding a person's identity. Each person has their own perception of you, influenced by their relationship and interactions with you. Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 1 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduce the character of the hawk and its desire for friendship with the ground squirrels.\n2. The hawk's confusion about the squirrels' lack of reciprocation.\n3. The hawk's preference for pink and confusion over others' preference for orange.\n4. The hawk's dream of leaving his current life behind and opening a portable dog wash.\n\nPassage:\nHigh in the sky, a sharp-eyed hawk watched the ground squirrels scurrying to and fro. He admired their sense of community and camaraderie and wished he could be part of it. The hawk often swooped down, hoping to interact with them, to play a part in their bustling society. However, the ground squirrels always ran away in fear. The hawk didn’t understand why the ground squirrels didn’t want to be his friend.\n\nIn his solitude, the hawk wondered if perhaps it was a matter of likes and dislikes. Maybe the ground squirrels were afraid of him because they didn’t like his appearance or his nature. He was a predator, after all. But the hawk believed in the possibility of change, in the ability of beings to overcome their innate tendencies. And if it was a matter of likes and dislikes, well, he thought, if I don’t like something, I’ll stay away from it.\n\nThe hawk also pondered over the peculiarities of preferences. For example, he could never understand why his fellow hawks always favored the orange glow of the setting sun. He, on the other hand, was in love with the soft pink hues of the dawn. He cherished the quiet and tranquillity of the early morning, the freshness of the new day. People keep telling me \"orange\" but I still prefer \"pink\", he mused.\n\nThroughout his reflections, the hawk realized that he wasn’t satisfied with his current situation. He longed for change, for a different kind of life. He wanted to leave his solitary existence behind, to do something that would bring him joy and fulfillment. And he had always had a fondness for dogs, envying their companionship with humans. Thus, he dreamed of leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 2 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\nThe first paragraph will introduce a character who enjoys hunting and roasting almonds in the forest. The second paragraph will shift to a character who is sitting alone in his bedroom, reflecting on the day’s activities. The third paragraph will describe a family barbecue that was overrun by ants. The final paragraph will focus on a hawk who is trying to understand why ground squirrels do not want to be friends with him.\n\nPassage:\nThere's something deeply gratifying about being in the wilderness, the smell of pine trees and the rustling of leaves underfoot. I am a hunter, but not the typical kind. I chase after my dreams and my prey with the same fervor and determination. My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.\n\nThe sun had set, and the room was filled with an eerie calmness as I sat alone, rubbing my sore calves. The day had been long and eventful, filled with visits to Grandpa Joe in the hospital and impromptu games of tug-of-war. It was during these quiet moments of reflection that I felt a strange presence. You realize you're not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n\nWe had planned a family barbecue to lighten the mood and bring everyone together. We slaved away, cooking ribs, burgers, and hot dogs, but our efforts were in vain. Despite precautions, a wave of tiny, uninvited guests flocked to our feast, leaving us to dine on the leftovers. The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.\n\nHigh above the ground, soaring between the towering trees, a lone hawk watched the ground squirrels scamper and play. He couldn't comprehend their fear and reluctance to approach him. He only wanted to befriend them, not realizing his predatory nature was intimidating. The hawk didn’t understand why the ground squirrels didn’t want to be his friend.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 3 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduction of the protagonist’s unusual sleepwalking habit.\n2. Description of the protagonist’s secret place he discovered through sleepwalking.\n3. Discussion of the protagonist’s failed attempts at creating art.\n4. Description of the protagonist's dangerous driving habits.\n\nPassage:\nEvan was a man of peculiar habits. He lived a normal life by day, working diligently in his office, but his nights were an entirely different story. Upon returning home, he would retire to his bed early, only to wake up in strange places the next morning. After consulting a sleep specialist, he understood the bizarre phenomenon. He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.\n\nOne night, his unconscious self took him to a place he'd never been before. It was a dark overpass, covered in a smattering of graffiti and discarded objects. Intrigued, Evan began to explore the area in his waking hours, finding an abandoned, hidden world that piqued his curiosity. The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.\n\nEvan, being an artist, saw inspiration in this hidden world. He started to create, using the raw materials he found in the overpass – old cans, pieces of metal, even his own bodily fluids. Yet, his pieces felt lackluster, devoid of the energy he saw in the overpass. He realized that his attempts to incorporate his literal sweat and tears into his work were not driving his art forward. He found his art never progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.\n\nHis eccentricities didn't stop at sleepwalking and art. Evan also had a unique approach to driving. He saw traffic cones not as safety measures, but as challenges to be overcome. As a result, he would swerve dangerously between them, much to the dismay of his passengers. It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 4 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduce the character Joe who is known for his innovative thinking and focus on his latest discovery about traffic cones.\n2. Present a scenario where the protagonist is alone in his/her room and suddenly realizes that he/she isn't alone after all.\n3. Introduce the protagonist's pet turtle and describe his/her strange concerns about the pet's perception.\n4. Introduce the snake who is part of a boy band, even though it doesn't make sense for a snake.\n\nPassage:\n\nJoe was always known for his innovative thinking. His mind was a treasure trove of unconventional ideas that always left people amazed. Once, he was stuck in a traffic jam, when he noticed a traffic cone lying nearby. On an impulse, he picked it up and started to speak into it. To his surprise, his voice was amplified – loud and clear. Thus, Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.\n\nAfter a day spent playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital, I found myself in the solitude of my bedroom. As I sat down to massage my aching calves, I heard a soft rustling sound. My heart pounded in my chest as I turned to see where it was coming from. To my relief, it was just my pet cat, Whiskers. But, the incident reminded me that even when I thought I was alone, I wasn't. You realize you're not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n\nI have a pet turtle named Franklin. He has an uncanny ability to fix his gaze on me when I'm thinking. It's almost as if he can read my thoughts. I know it sounds crazy, but the more I observed this, the more concerned I became. I even tried to think about different things to see if his gaze would change. But it remained the same - deep, knowing, and strangely insightful. I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.\n\nThe most peculiar character in my life is my pet snake, Slither. Despite being a reptile and unable to sing or dance, Slither is part of a local boy band. The kids love him and he has become quite a sensation. I still can't wrap my head around how a snake ended up in a boy band. But then again, life is full of surprises. He's in a boy band which doesn't make much sense for a snake.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 5 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1.

Detail the character's activities after the day's events.\n4. Describe the character's dislikes and how they react towards them.\n\nPassage:\n\nJacob was a peculiar individual, his laziness was not a secret to anyone. He was known to avoid any unnecessary activity, preferring to spend his time lounging around than doing anything remotely strenuous. People often marveled at his ability to get through life doing the bare minimum. He was surprised that his immense laziness was inspirational to others.\n\nWhen his sister was planning her bachelorette party, Jacob was given the task of organizing the event. However, instead of planning a night out with her friends, he decided to arrange an in-house movie night. He figured it would require less effort and he wouldn't have to leave the comfort of his couch. Instead of a bachelorette party, he planned a lazy night in, much to everyone’s amusement.\n\nAfter the movie night, Jacob found himself unusually exhausted. He had spent the day playing tug-of-war in the hospital with his Grandpa Joe, who was recovering from a leg surgery. He had never been one for physical exertion, and the day’s activities took a toll on him. As he sat in his bedroom massaging his calves, he took comfort in the fact that he was not alone.\n\nJacob had always lived by a simple philosophy, if he didn't like something, he would avoid it. This applied to everything from spicy food to social events. He found no pleasure in forcing himself to tolerate things he disliked. He believed that life was too short to waste on things that didn't bring joy. If he didn’t like something, he’d stay away from it.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 6 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\nThe plan is to begin with the protagonist's morning routine, followed by his/her relationship with Grandpa Joe. In the third paragraph, the protagonist will delve into their grandfather's mental state and, finally, end with a metaphorical description of themselves.\n\nPassage:\nIt was a morning like any other. I lazily dragged myself out of bed, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes as I made my way to the kitchen. I poured my favorite cereal into a bowl, only to realize there was no milk left in the refrigerator. I quickly dialed the number for the local grocery delivery service. For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn't consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.\n\nAfter breakfast, I headed to the hospital to visit Grandpa Joe. He was getting weaker with each passing day, but his spirit remained indomitable. We used to play tug-of-war and even though he was in a hospital bed, he still wanted to keep the tradition alive. You realize you're not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n\nGrandpa Joe was a man of many layers, his mind a complex labyrinth of thoughts and memories. Each day, as his physical strength deteriorated, he seemed to retreat further into his mind, isolating himself from the rest of us. I often wondered if it was a conscious choice or a defense mechanism. He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.\n\nGrowing up, I looked up to Grandpa Joe, his strength, resilience, and wisdom. His zest for life was infectious. I learned to face adversities head-on, to fight, to burn with passion for life. In retrospect, I think the fire that burned in Grandpa Joe ignited within me too. I’m a living furnace.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 7 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduce the setting and establish the protagonist's relationship with Grandpa Joe.\n2. Describe the events leading up to the car crash.\n3. Introduce the character of Rick Shaw and hint at his usefulness.\n4. Describe a typical driving experience with Rick Shaw.\n\nPassage:\nThe day started off with the usual quiet routine of my suburban household, waking up early for a cup of coffee and a glance at the newspaper. It was a bright morning, birds chirping and the smell of dew on the grass wafting through the open window. Grandpa Joe was in the hospital again, his age catching up with him in the form of a weak heart. It wasn't all bad, as it gave us an opportunity to bond over games of tug-of-war, a playful rivalry that we had going. You realize you're not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n\nPulling out of the driveway, I noticed my brakes feeling a bit spongy, but I dismissed it as nothing serious. The drive to the hospital was uneventful, with the traffic light and the streets still sleepy from the early morning hour. It was only when I returned home that I realized the seriousness of the situation. Today arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.\n\nIn moments of crisis, you often find yourself thinking of the most random things. As I sat in my wrecked car, staring at the ruins of my garage, a name popped into my mind - Rick Shaw. We were friends in high school, and despite his name, he was no helpful vehicle. I had a friend in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.\n\nRick was always more of a liability on the road. He had this reckless streak to him, treating every drive as an adrenaline-fueled adventure. He had a particular fondness for safety cones, viewing them as more of a challenge than a warning. It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 8 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\nThe first paragraph will introduce a character who is facing prosecution and his decision to fake his disappearance to avoid jail. The second paragraph will describe his previous job as a clown and his serious nature when performing. The third paragraph will explain the weather conditions of his location in June. The final paragraph will describe his struggles navigating the snowy backcountry.\n\nPassage:\nFor as long as he could remember, Michael had always been a bit of a rogue, constantly finding himself on the wrong side of the law. This time, however, he had been caught in a serious fraud case. The evidence was stacked against him, and he knew that this time, he wouldn't be able to talk his way out of it. He decided to fake his disappearance to avoid jail.\n\nBefore he was a fugitive, Michael was a clown at a local circus. To him, it was more than just a job - it was a performance, a spectacle. When he donned his clown suit, he wasn't the rogue anymore; he was a performer, and the ring was his stage. He was all business when he wore his clown suit.\n\nMichael decided to disappear in June, a time of the year when the town was often under heavy rain. Rain provided the perfect cover for his escape; the inclement weather would discourage anyone from venturing outside. Besides, the rain would wash away any traces of his journey. We have a lot of rain in June.\n\nHis plan was to escape into the backcountry. He had spent his childhood exploring the area and knew the landscape like the back of his hand. However, the heavy snowfall had transformed the familiar terrain into an alien landscape. The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 9 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1.

Introduce a teenager who encounters a rotary dial phone and can't figure out how to use it. \n4. Describe a woman who embarks on a journey living in her van with her pets and faces unexpected challenges.\n\nPassage:\nIn the small town of Stillwater, a contentious dispute was brewing. Two neighbors, each with different views, had decided to settle their ongoing argument by installing a fence between their properties. One saw it as a means of confinement, keeping his prized roses safe from outside harm. The other viewed it as a barrier to keep unwanted intruders at bay. The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town, David prepared for a daring adventure. He had been waiting for this day, for the perfect cover - the super bowl. As the town folks gathered around their televisions, consumed by the game’s frenzy, David seized the opportunity. With everyone distracted, he slipped unnoticed into the town museum. He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.\n\nIn the museum, a group of teenagers were participating in a guided tour. Upon stumbling across a vintage exhibit, one of the teenagers was faced with an unexpected conundrum. Among the relics was a rotary dial phone, a foreign entity to him. He picked it up, stared at it, and turned it around in his hands, unsure of its operation. When confronted with a rotary dial phone, the teenager was perplexed.\n\nAcross the state line, a young woman named Ella was embarking on a new lifestyle. She had decided to give up her apartment and live on the road in her van, accompanied by her two cats and a dog. However, the tight quarters and the constant chaos of her pets made the journey less idyllic than she had imagined. She discovered van life is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 10 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1.

Introduce a girl named Lily who has a vivid imagination, and how she views the world differently from others.\n4. Describe the children's disappointment when they discover there's no ice cream left in the freezer, and their lack of money to buy more.\n\nPassage:\nJake's first summer camp experience was turning out to be more challenging than he had thought. He lay on his bunk, wide awake in the darkness, listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the wilderness. His mind kept wandering back to the comforts of his home: the smell of his mom's apple pie baking in the oven, the laughter of his siblings playing in the backyard, and the crunch of his dad's famous green apples fresh from the tree. As sleep finally overcame him, he dreamed of eating green apples with worms.\n\nThe following morning, Jake's melancholy hung heavily in the cabin. His homesickness was palpable and soon, the other campers started feeling it too. They began sharing stories of their families, their pets, and the things they missed most about home. Even the most stoic of the group, a burly boy named Max, admitted to missing his mom's homemade lasagna. Homesickness became contagious in the young campers' cabin.\n\nLily, the only girl in the group, was different. She lived in her world of imagination. While the boys spoke of their homes, she stared at the vast sky above them. To her, the fluffy clouds were not just clouds; they were fairy floss, the kind one could get at the county fair. She would describe the sky with such fervor that the others would stare at her, bewildered. She couldn't understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.\n\nLater in the day, the campers decided to treat themselves to some ice cream to lift their spirits. Disappointment washed over them as they opened the freezer to find it empty. They rummaged through their pockets, hoping to scrape together enough change for a trip to the nearby store. But it was futile. There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 11 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\nThe first paragraph will introduce a character seeking a precious gem to complete a collection.

In the third paragraph, the character encounters an archaic piece of technology he has no idea how to use. The final paragraph will culminate in the character's realization that he is out of his depth and perhaps his quest was misguided.\n\nPassage:\nDeep within the labyrinthine market of Marrakesh, Ahmed searched for the elusive sapphire that would complete his collection. As a gem enthusiast, he had traveled far and wide to acquire the rarest gems. Yet, the elusive sapphire remained out of his grasp. He soon realized that the pursuit of the perfect gem was not as fulfilling as he thought. A glittering gem is not enough.\n\nAhmed's quest grew more difficult when he discovered that the gem was in the possession of a notorious dealer known for his cunning and deceit. His attempts to negotiate felt as futile as trying to play tennis with a bowling ball. Every stratagem he employed was countered with a shrewder one. The dealer was a formidable opponent, indeed. It's much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the dealer proposed a trade instead of a sale. Ahmed would receive the sapphire if he could place a call using the antique telephone on the dealer's desk. With its rotary dial and corded handset, the device was alien to Ahmed, who was used to sleek smartphones. When confronted with a rotary dial phone, the teenager was perplexed.\n\nAhmed left the market, his spirit deflated. He had not obtained the sapphire, but he gained a newfound wisdom. He realized that his obsession with the gem had led him on a wild goose chase, distracting him from what truly mattered. There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn't it.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 12 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\nIn the first paragraph, I will introduce a whimsical setting where animals interact in unusual ways. In the second paragraph, I will focus on an ill-planned family picnic that turns out better for the ants. The third paragraph will introduce a massive Great Dane whose size and appearance evoke that of a horse. Finally, the fourth paragraph will wrap up the narrative by highlighting the elegance of a gliding pelican amidst other sea birds.\n\nPassage:\nIn a peculiar world where animals have taken on human-like characteristics, a blue parrot was known for its odd fascination with automobiles. This parrot, unlike others of its kind, spent its days admiring and driving a little red car around the neighborhood. Every now and then, it would spot a hitchhiking mongoose, a fellow oddball, on the side of the road and offer a ride. The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.\n\nMeanwhile, a nearby family was attempting to have a nice barbecue in their backyard. However, their lack of preparation led to a series of unfortunate events, including undercooked food and a sudden downpour. Unbeknownst to them, a colony of ants had discovered the fallen scraps of food. They were feasting, relishing in a surprise banquet. The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.\n\nOn the other side of town, a pet owner was struggling with his oversized Great Dane. This dog, named Brutus, was so large that passerby frequently mistook him for a small horse. With his sleek, glossy coat and strong, muscular build, Brutus was indeed an imposing sight. Despite his owner's reassurances, people still couldn't shake the feeling that the Great Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.\n\nAs the day wound down, and the sun began to set, the town's residents gathered at the beach to watch the sea birds. Seagulls, cormorants, and terns filled the sky, each displaying its unique grace and beauty. But as soon as a lone pelican began its glide over the ocean, all eyes were drawn to its majestic flight. Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 13 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1.

Introduce a mysterious character with mirrored sunglasses and create intrigue about his intentions.\n3. Bring in the fox in the tophat character and introduce a secretive conversation between him and a rabbit.\n4. Finally, introduce a snake character who is unexpectedly part of a boy band.\n\nPassage:\n\nIn the heart of the forest, the murder hornet was often misunderstood. He was feared and loathed by the other animals due to his aggressive reputation. Yet, he was no different than them, just trying to survive in this vast wilderness. Despite his numerous attempts to be friendly, no one could see past his fearsome facade. The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.\n\nElsewhere in the forest, a brooding figure stood alone. His eyes were hidden behind mirrored sunglasses, concealing his true emotions. The other animals couldn't help but be drawn to his silent charisma. Yet, they also felt a sense of unease as they couldn't read his thoughts or intentions. She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses. \n\nIn the depths of the forest, a fox in a tophat was plotting. He was known for his cunning and always had a scheme up his sleeve. As the sun set, he slinked over to a rabbit, who was innocently nibbling on a piece of lettuce. Leaning in, the fox in the tophat whispered something into the ear of the rabbit.\n\nOn the other side of the forest, a snake was practising his singing. His scales shimmered in the moonlight as he moved rhythmically to the beat. The other animals found it odd that a snake could sing, let alone be part of a musical group. But he was undeterred and enjoyed the thrill of performing. Despite the unusual combination, he was part of a boy band which didn't make much sense for a snake.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 14 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1.

Introduce a sudden change in the character's reality when she looks into a mirror.\n4. Narrate an unusual weather event that turns the whole situation around.\n\nPassage:\nJames lived in a small, messy apartment filled with strange objects. His collection was made up of items he found on the streets - discarded furniture, broken appliances, and his favorite, glassware. He had an unexplainable fascination with glass, be it bottles, jars, or broken pieces of window panes. He would carefully clean and then stack them in his kitchen cupboard. There's probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium, he often thought.\n\nOne sunny day, he decided to visit the beach to add to his collection. He anticipated finding unique shells or perhaps, washed up pieces of glass. However, his day didn't go as planned. The beach was filled with children building sandcastles and people basking in the sun. He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.\n\nWhen he got back home, he felt different. He went to the bathroom to wash off the sand and looked into the mirror. Suddenly, he didn't see his own reflection staring back at him. Instead, he saw a woman with a crown of shells on her head and an ethereal glow around her. She looked into the mirror and saw another person.\n\nJust as he was about to scream, he heard a loud rumble outside. The sky darkened, and a rainstorm began. The rain was so heavy that it started to flood the streets. Suddenly, he saw a sight that would forever be etched in his memory. The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 15 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1.

The third paragraph will describe a person's reaction to a popular TV show, explaining their lack of interest in the first season and their decision to ignore the second. \n4.

He gazed out at the stars and the world spinning beneath him, a sight so surreal that it felt like a dream. In the silence of space, he took a moment to remove his helmet, expecting the void to be as odorless as it was soundless. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nOn the crowded streets of the city, a busker strummed his guitar and sang songs of love and loss. His voice echoed through the urban canyons, competing with the clamor of car horns and the murmur of passersby. He held out his hat, expecting the usual coins and occasional bills from generous souls. The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw money, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.\n\nEvery night after work, I would sit down with a cup of tea and turn on the television. One show in particular had caught the world's attention, a tale of political intrigue and dragons. I gave it a shot, hoping to understand the hype but found it lacking in substance and originality. Honestly, I didn't care much for the first season, so I didn't bother with the second.\n\nToday started like any other day. I woke up, made a pot of coffee, and prepared for work. I was running a bit late, so I rushed through my morning routine and dashed to the car. I put it in gear and hit the gas, but in my haste, I forgot one crucial step. Today arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 16 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduce a family living in tough conditions, scraping by, but maintaining a positive outlook on life.\n2. Describe a trip to the beach, where they find joy in the simple pleasures of nature.\n3. Incorporate an unexpected event, in this case, mountain lions appearing in their neighborhood.\n4. Finally, introduce a humorous, seemingly unrelated event that further emphasizes their positive outlook and adaptability.\n\nPassage:\nEven in the face of adversity, the Johnson family always found a way to keep their spirits high. That Tuesday evening, after a long day of hard work, the children begged for a sweet treat to cap off the night. Their faces fell when they opened the freezer, hoping for a scoop of their favorite ice cream, but finding it empty. There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.\n\nDetermined to keep their spirits up, the family decided to take a walk to the beach the next day. The salty air filled their lungs as they laughed and played in the sand, forgetting, if only for a moment, their struggles. As the sun began to set, they sat on the sandy shore, watching as the fiery orb sunk into the horizon. The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.\n\nThe next morning, however, their positive outlook was tested when they woke to an unusual sight. The peaceful neighborhood they knew was replaced by a scene straight out of a wildlife documentary. He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.\n\nDespite the challenges they faced, the Johnson family always found a way to make the best out of a bad situation. They even managed to come up with a new game to pass the time while they were stuck indoors. It was a bit of a stretch, but they found that it's much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 17 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduce Joe, a creative and innovative character.\n2. Describe a cold winter day where the protagonist realized they were unusually warm.\n3. Describe a near-death experience and the aftermath.\n4. Introduce the pet turtle and the protagonist's paranoia about it.\n\nPassage:\nJoe was a peculiar, yet inventive character. Among his many eccentricities, he had an uncanny knack for finding unconventional uses for everyday objects. One day, as he was walking home, he found a stack of discarded traffic cones. Joe was never one to let potential go to waste, so he carried them home. After experimenting with them, Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.\n\nWinter had swept in, coating the city in a thick blanket of snow. Everyone was bundled up in layers upon layers of clothing, yet I found myself comfortably warm. My friends joked that I was a human heater, as I walked around in a light jacket, seemingly unaffected by the freezing temperatures. It was then that I realized, I wasn’t just warm. I was overbearingly hot, I’m a living furnace.\n\nOne day, while crossing the road, I nearly got hit by a speeding car. It was a close call, and the accident that almost was, gave me a new perspective on life. I realized how short and unpredictable life can be and I started to question my existing views and beliefs. I decided to live my life to the fullest, to take risks and to explore new things. The near-death experience brought new ideas to light.\n\nRecently, I've noticed a strange change in my pet turtle, Speedy. He would watch me intently, his beady eyes following my every move. It was as if he was studying me, trying to understand my thoughts and actions. I laughed it off at first, but as days passed, his behavior became more peculiar. He would react to my thoughts before I even made a move. It was uncanny and I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 18 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Introduce a character who is a new pet owner trying to understand the behavior of their pet rabbit. \n2. Introduce a new character who gives advice to the pet owner on how to manage the rabbit's behavior, but the pet owner is unsure whether to trust this person.\n3. After a long day, the pet owner is left alone to reflect on their day and the advice they were given.\n4. The pet owner attempts to distract their rabbit with strawberries and paint, but realizes it's not a good combination.\n\nPassage:\nAs a new pet owner, you've been finding it increasingly difficult to manage your pet rabbit's erratic behavior. He's been chewing on electrical cords, digging holes in your favorite Persian rug, and generally causing havoc around the house. You've tried following the advice in the pet instruction manual, but it's not working. You sigh, realizing that the written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can't read.\n\nYou decide to seek advice from a rabbit whisperer who claims he can communicate with your furry friend. His name is Ezekiel, a man with a wild beard and eyes that sparkle with mischief. He tells you that the rabbit is acting out because he's bored and suggests some unconventional methods to keep him entertained. You're unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.\n\nExhausted from the day, you retreat to your bedroom for some peace and quiet. As you sit on your bed, massaging your sore calves, you reflect on the day's events. You had been playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital, a strange but fun distraction from the chaos at home. As the moonlight filters through the window, you realize you're not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n\nIn the morning, you decide to try one of Ezekiel's suggestions. He suggested painting with your pet rabbit, claiming it could be an interesting exercise in bonding. You decide to incorporate strawberries into the activity, remembering how much your rabbit loves them. But as you watch your rabbit sniff the paint and turn away from the strawberries, you realize that strawberries must be the one food that doesn't go well with this brand of paint.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n=== Problem 19 ===\nfunctools.partial(<function gpt at 0x7df9c4266560>, model='gpt-4', temperature=0.7)\n\nAnswer:\nPlan:\n1. Describe a painting class where the students are using fruit to inspire their art, but the specific brand of paint doesn't mesh well with the color of strawberries. \n2. Introduce a character, Joe, who is an unconventional thinker and uses a traffic cone to communicate in the large, noisy class. \n3. Introduce a character who is painting roses and is reflecting on the symbolic meaning of their thorns. \n4. Introduce a character who travels around the world to attend different art classes as a form of therapy.\n\nPassage:\nMary took a step back from her canvas, squinting at the still life of fruit she'd been tasked with painting. She was satisfied with her rendition of the apples and bananas, but the strawberries were giving her problems. No matter how she mixed it, the paint refused to capture the strawberries' vibrant red color. She sighed, thinking, strawberries must be the one food that doesn't go well with this brand of paint.\n\nAcross the room, a loud voice suddenly cut through the chatter of the painting class. It was Joe, who was known for his unconventional methods. He had found a discarded traffic cone outside and was now using it as a makeshift megaphone to share his thoughts on abstract expressionism. As the class listened in bemused silence, Joe proved once again that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.\n\nIn the corner, a woman named Lara was quietly working on a painting of roses. Each stroke of her brush seemed to imbue the flowers with life, but she took special care when painting the thorns. Lara believed that each thorn represented a struggle or challenge, and that a rose without thorns would lack character. To her, there's a reason that roses have thorns.\n\nMeanwhile, a world-traveler named Sophie was attending her first class in this particular studio. She had been to countless art classes all over the world, using each as a way to explore new cultures and perspectives. Sophie found that traveling and learning new things was a much more enjoyable way of dealing with life's ups and downs than traditional therapy. So, in her mind, she traveled because it cost the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n[6]\n0s\nprint(ys[0])\nPlan:\n1. Introduce the main character as someone who is often perceived as lazy.\n2. Describe the main character's surprising influence on others.\n3. Introduce the scenario of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n4. Discuss the character's dislikes and his approach to them.\n\nPassage:\nJake was a peculiar character. He was not much for adventure or exertion and preferred to spend his days lounging about, doing as little as possible. His friends often chastised him for his lack of ambition, but Jake was content in his indifference. He was surprised that his immense laziness was inspirational to others.\n\nHis friends started to see the benefits of his laid-back lifestyle, and they began to incorporate elements of it into their own lives. They found that by taking things slower, they were less stressed and more appreciative of the little things in life. Jake was pleased to see the positive impact he was having on his friends. Instead of a bachelorette party, they ended up having a relaxation retreat, all thanks to Jake's influence.\n\nOne day, Jake found himself in an unexpected situation. His Grandpa Joe was in the hospital and requested Jake to play tug-of-war with him as a form of therapy. This was a far cry from Jake's usual leisurely activities, but he couldn't refuse his Grandpa Joe. You realize you're not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.\n\nJake learned a lot from that experience. He realized that sometimes, he might have to step out of his comfort zone for the ones he loved. But he also understood his limits and knew that he would not engage in activities that he didn't like. He preferred a peaceful, slow-paced life and would not compromise on that. If I don’t like something, I’ll stay away from it.\n"
